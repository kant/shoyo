> A light css library for my projects

Currently in beta. Will release soon !  

# Why ?

I'm used to bootstrap, but that's too heavy. So i went with this for basic projects. This will contain all most required css i.e. grids, buttons,background,typography etc.

# Features

- Light weight
- Customizable
- Simple design (I love that ðŸ¤—)
