> A light and Minimal CSS Library


!> shoyo is in alpha. Not recommended for production as codebase changes are frequent.

# Motivation 

`shoyo` is primarily created for those developers who customise their project heavily without any huge css libraries like `Bootstrap`. shoyo adds a very basic styling for the developer to customize. It's a `developer friendly` library in a sense where customisation is done primarily.

# Why ?

I'm a matured `Bootstrap` user and in my views It's great for the projects where the UI, Color, Feel and size is not a priority. It's ideal for fastrack projects. But after usig Bootstrap for a long long duration, I realised that my projects are built upon heavily customised Bootstrap. So when I deployed my projects, they are slow with unused css and not to mention `jQuery`. So i thought of creating shoyo as a css library with the most basic styling for me to customise upon.
